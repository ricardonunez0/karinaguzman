            I grew up in Southern California, always having a love for fashion. I began working in retail after high
            school, and by age 19, I was a visual merchandiser at Forever 21.<br /><br />Putting together outfits for
            people, floors, and mannequins became my passion. I absolutely love helping clients find the right piece,
            the right silhouette, and the right fit,&nbsp;&nbsp;building a real connection and seeing what fits for
            them, not what looks good to me.<br /><br />This passion of mine, of finding the right outfit for the right
            person, made me realize how much I love styling as a career, and since then, I’ve been absorbing what seems
            like millions of different stylists’ takes on new seasons, new trends, and new themes.<br /><br />I’m new to
            the career field of styling, but I’m not new to visual work, putting together recommendations, or bringing
            my love for fashion to every client I have, and I’m super excited to be transitioning to styling full time.
